I had just moved to a new school and it was my first day. During lunch, I went to find a place to sit but all the tables were full. I stood there with my tray, looking around, and people kept glancing at me. I finally found a spot at the end of a table and sat down. The group there suddenly got quiet and started whispering. One girl loudly asked who I was. I tried to introduce myself but knocked over my milk. It spilled all over my pants and the table. Everyone started laughing and pointing. I tried to clean it up but made it worse. The cafeteria monitor came over with paper towels but by then my food was ruined and my pants were soaked. I had to go to the nurse's office to call home for new clothes. I spent the rest of the day smelling like sour milk and everyone kept calling me "milk boy" for weeks after.
My grandma died and I had to give a speech at her funeral. I was really close with her but I kept putting off writing anything because thinking about it made me too sad. The morning of the funeral I quickly wrote some notes on my phone. When it was my turn to speak, I went up to the podium and my mind just went blank. I couldn't even read my notes properly because my hands were shaking so bad. I started crying in the middle of a sentence and couldn't stop. My dad had to come up and help me back to my seat. I felt like I let my grandma down because I couldn't even say anything nice about her. Everyone kept telling me it was okay but I saw my aunt looking disappointed. What made it worse was my cousin went after me and gave this perfect speech with funny stories about grandma and everyone was laughing and nodding. I just sat there feeling like I'd ruined the only chance I had to say goodbye to her properly.
I went on this camping trip with some friends I wasn't super close with. It was raining the whole first day so we stayed in our tents. The second night we were sitting around the fire and someone suggested we play truth or dare. When it was my turn I picked truth and they asked about my biggest fear. I don't know why but I started talking about how my parents got divorced when I was 10 and how I was afraid of ending up alone. I got really emotional and started crying a little bit. Everyone got super quiet and uncomfortable. One guy was like "dude it's just a game" and changed the subject. For the rest of the trip everyone treated me differently, like I was fragile or something. They'd stop talking when I came around or change the subject. On the last day I overheard two of them making fun of me for "having a breakdown over truth or dare." I pretended I was sick for the last day and just stayed in my tent until it was time to go home. None of them really talked to me much after that trip.
